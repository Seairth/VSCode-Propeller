# VSCode-Propeller
Visual Studio Code Extension(s) for Parallax Propeller product(s)

##spin
This extension is for the Propeller Spin language.  It currently only provides syntax highlighting.

##p2asm
This extension is for the P2 Assembly language.  It currently only provides syntax highlighting.  Note that the extension expects the ".p2asm" filename extension, not ".spin"

> __Note:__ Once you clone the repository, you need to install the missing node modules before you can use the extension.  You can do so by opening a command prompt in the extension folder ("p2asm" or "spin") and entering `npm install`.  You can then open the folder in VSCode and "build" the extension by typing Ctrl+Shift+B (or by hitting F1, then start typing `build` and select the "Tasks: Run Build Task" from the filtered command list).
